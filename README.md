### USER STORY
- AS A PROGRAMMER AND CONSTANT RESEARCHER, I WANT A SINGLE SITE
WHERE I CAN ADD and ORGANIZE LINKS.<br>
- I WANT TO ADD KEYWORDS AND CATEGORIES WHEN I ADD A SITE.<br>
- I WANT TO BE ABLE TO RETRIEVE BY CATEGORY AND BY KEYWORD.<br>
- LINKS SHOULD BE CLICKABLE FROM THE SITE.

### DESCRIPTION
- I use different browsers with different settings.
- Rather than manage and share my bookmarks across chrome, firefox, vivaldi, safari etc.,
- I'd like to  house my browser favorites on a single site.
- I'd like to be able to add categories and tags(keywords) so that I can retrieve them by those terms.

# DESCRIPTION

I use different browsers with different settings.
Rather than manage and share my bookmarks across chrome, firefox, vivaldi, safari etc.,
I'd like to  house my browser favorites on a single site.
I'd like to be able to add categories and tags(keywords) so that I can retrieve them by those terms.
